useSelector  = we can access the state without subscribing it this done all work in internally
useDispatcher = return the dispatcher

connect(mapStateProps,mapDispatchProps)(class componet)

when we update old state the we need to overide all the state

never mutate state like - state.conter++;

only override the state and return brand new object

alway copy and create new object

it above all about the core redux functionality

use see more easy way to do this 
1)action identifiers - typo error
2)managing amount of data in that bigger files
   export const INCREMENT = 'increment'
3)state immutability
